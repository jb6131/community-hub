From here, the user can login or signup. They are also able to view the list of posted community needs, but will be unable to participate until they have logged in or signed up. Once the user has created their account, they will then be able to create their own need and post it onto the community board. They will also be able to sign up to participate in a community project by clicking on the 'Participate in this community project' link. The user will also have access to their Profile page, where they can see a list of their own posted needs and remove them if so desired.
